      <h1>Coding Background</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm currently aiming to become a Full Stack Engineer. I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Computational and Systems Biology, where I first got my foot into the door of the coding world. I took three traditional coding classes with a focus on C++. I went on to do research at Dr. Willy Hugo's lab, where I learned R, Python, and Command Line to an intermediate level. After graduation, I decided to enroll in UCSD's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, SQL, Mongo, and React.</p>
