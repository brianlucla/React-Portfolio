        Hi! I'm currently aiming to become a Full Stack Engineer. I graduated
        from UCLA with a degree in Computational and Systems Biology, where I
        first got my foot into the door of the coding world. I took three
        traditional coding classes with a focus on C++. I went on to do research
        at Dr. Willy Hugo's lab, where I learned R, Python, and Command Line to
        an intermediate level. After graduation, I decided to enroll in UCSD's
        Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        NodeJS, SQL, Mongo, and React.
